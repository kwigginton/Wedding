<h3 id="c-custom-title"><span>Child care needs during the ceremony</span></h3>
<div id="c-custom-container">
<div class="c-intro"><p>We kindly ask that all children under 10 years old join the child care that will be provided. We know that ceremonies can be, well, a bit boring for our wiggly wee ones.  :)</p>
<p>To alleviate anxiety that you may have about placing your child into the care of others, please know that our child care providers are trusted and used by many parents at the church. The care providers have gone through background checks and finger printing.</p>
<p>When you RSVP, please check the box indicating your need for child care so that we can ensure we have a suitable number of providers. We will contact you after we have received your RSVP.</p>
